# 054 - Fork Lifter

*Hungry? Hope you have good reflexes!* - Rhythm Heaven Fever

Fork Lifter is a **Cue-Based** game.

### Cues

|Name|Description|Length (beats)|
|---|---|---|
|`Flick Food`|Flicks a pea. You can use this as many times as you want, <br></br>but peas will stop appearing on the fork if <br></br>at four peas.|3|
|`Prepare`|The hand readies itself to flick a pea. It will stay prepared<br></br> until a pea is flicked.|0.5|
|`Swallow`|The fork goes offscreen and the person swallows. When the fork comes back,<br></br> all peas are gone.|1|
|`Sigh`|Plays the sigh sound effect.|1|

### Properties

|Cue|Variable|Options|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`Flick Food`|Object|Pea, TopBun, Burger, BottomBun|Chooses the item to be flicked.|

### Tips
- Try not to stack more than four peas with `Flick Food`; use `Swallow` to clear the fork out first.
	- In addition, try to be very reserved with having four peas on any given fork- this should be saved for special occasions in your remix, much like in Remix 2 Wii.
- Make sure to use `Prepare` regularly before `Flick Food` cues! Usually, it will play before any given set of 1-4 cues.
- `Switch Game` starts you out with 0 peas, so no need to gulp in a short segment beforehand.
- When a full burger is assembled, `Swallow` will play a different, more "crunchy" sound.
- `Sigh` is best used after `Swallow` after a big event- typically the end of the remix. It gives a lot of impact!

### Legality
- Don't stack `Flick Food` cues on top of each other.
- Do not have `Swallow` interrupted by the stab of a `Flick Food` cue.

### Known Bugs and Issues
- The burger objects do not display correctly in the zoom-in bubble.
- A pea stack of four doesn't display correctly; the fourth pea will appear above the first pea instead of below the third pea.
